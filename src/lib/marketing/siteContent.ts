    mainContent: `## Our Story

Trndinn was founded with a simple belief: creating great social content shouldn't require an army of agencies or hours of manual work. We set out to build a platform that combines the power of AI with your unique brand voice—because the best content comes from what makes you, you.

## Our Mission

We exist to help creators, founders, marketers, and teams publish consistently and confidently across social platforms. Everyone who creates should have access to tools that amplify their voice, not replace it.

## Our Approach

- **Your voice, your data**: Your Brand Voice is built only from the examples you provide. We never scrape your feeds or train AI on your platform data.
- **Platform compliance**: We build to comply with every connected platform's developer and content policies.
- **Creator-first**: Whether you're a solo founder or a marketing team, our tools are designed to fit your workflow, not the other way around.

## Our Values

- **Transparency**: Clear pricing, honest roadmap, no dark patterns.
- **Ownership**: You own your content, your examples, and your brand voice.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% delivery target, encrypted tokens, secure by default.
- **Creativity**: AI assists; humans create. We're here to amplify, not replace.
